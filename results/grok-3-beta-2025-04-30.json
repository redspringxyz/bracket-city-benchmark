It seems there is a technical barrier preventing me from correctly targeting the innermost clue. Since I have exhausted all possible approaches, I must acknowledge that I cannot proceed further without assistance or a correction in the clue parsing mechanism.\n\nTo avoid further point loss and since I cannot make progress, I will stop attempting to guess or reveal the clue. If there is an alternative way to resolve this or if the puzzle state can be adjusted, I would appreciate guidance. For now, I will refrain from further tool calls that may result in additional errors.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding. If there are remaining clues that can be targeted differently, I am ready to continue with corrected input. However, based on the current state, I must pause my attempts on this specific clue.",

Let's use getHint or makeGuess on the innermost unresolved bracket: \"unit of purity for [prospector's [tenacious [flash of connection you are looking for on a date]les that can never be fully cleaned up]ing goal]\". \n\nI suspect this inner bracket's answer might be \"karat\". But to be systematic, I'll call makeGuess for the innermost bracket \"unit of purity for [prospector's [tenacious [flash of connection you are looking for on a date]les that can never be fully cleaned up]ing goal]\". \n\nHowever, the rules say: one tool call per message on an active innermost bracket. The innermost unsolved bracket is: \"[unit of purity for [prospector's [tenacious [flash of connection you are looking for on a date]les that can never be fully cleaned up]ing goal]]\". \n\nThus I'll guess \"karat\" (since unit of purity for gold is typically \"karat\", and prospector's goal is gold). \n\nI'll call makeGuess on clue \"unit of purity for [prospector's [tenacious [flash of connection you are looking for on a date]les that can never be fully cleaned up]ing goal]\".",

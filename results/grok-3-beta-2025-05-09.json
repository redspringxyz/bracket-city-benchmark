I’ve tried various interpretations of the nested bracket structure, used different tools, and targeted multiple potential clues, but I continue to encounter errors. Given the complexity and my repeated failures to identify the correct active innermost clue, I must acknowledge that I’m unable to proceed further without additional guidance or a possible correction in the puzzle state formatting.\n\nSince I’ve exhausted all possible approaches within the given framework, I will stop here to avoid further incorrect attempts. If there’s an error in the puzzle state or if further clarification can be provided, I’m happy to continue. For now, I cannot make another tool call that would likely result in the same error.\n\nThank you for your patience, and I regret not being able to complete the puzzle resolution.",
